- [x] Fix Parsing vertices from .obj file
- [x] Figure out adding Mesh to Obj struct
- [x] Debug vector subscript out of range
- [x] Creating Mesh object gives me a vector subscript out range error
- [x] Process faces and vertices at the same time 
- [x] Able to render mesh
- [x] Figure out why the full mesh isn't being rendered
        - possible indices being lost? (glDrawElements(GL_QUADS)) instead of GL_TRIANGLES because I was parsing quad indices.
- [x] Add an option to either parse QUADS or TRIANGLES. (Maybe add a flag)
- [x] Parse texture normals and texture coords 
- [ ] Parse material (usemtl) 
- [ ] Change absolute path input on Import.ReadFile to the relative path input
- [ ] Render bag model 
- [ ] Implement a toggle for glPolygon -> FILL and NONE? 
- [x] Bug: when vt is added to .obj file then it crashes
